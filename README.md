This repository contains my codes for the course Operating Systems (CSC 3150) at CUHK(SZ). The codes are only for your reference.

Please be aware that:
1. I did not get any bonus score for Assignment 1.
2. My Assignment 2 bonus got 2 points penalty due to time complexity.
3. There used to be some large files (some output logs) in the git history. I am too lazy to do a rebase, so I used filter-branch, which means the codes might be screwed XD.
4. I do not support plagiarism. Please don't simply copy+paste. I am not responsible for any grade deduction.

As of Fall 2022, the support for CUDA debugging in VS Code is still not very good. Please refer to my [other repository](https://github.com/SE-starshippilot/CSC3150-Cuda-Debug)for more information.

Have fun coding!
